[[bulkhead]]
== Bulkhead

The `Bulkhead` pattern is to prevent faults in one part of the system from cascading to the entire system, which might bring down the whole system.
The implementation is to limit the number of concurrent requests accessing an instance. Therefore, `Bulkhead` pattern is only effective when applying `@Bulkhead` to a component that can be accessed from multiple contexts.

=== Bulkhead Usage
A method or class can be annotated with `@Bulkhead`, which means the method or the methods under the class will have Bulkhead policy applied correspondingly.
There are two different approaches to the bulkhead: thread pool isolation and semaphore isolation.
When `@Bulkhead` is used with `@Asynchronous`, the thread pool isolation approach will be used.
If `@Bulkhead` is used without `@Asynchronous`, the semaphore isolation approach will be used.
The thread pool approach allows to configure the maximum concurrent requests together with the waiting queue size.
The semaphore approach only allows the concurrent number of requests configuration.

==== Semaphore style Bulkhead

The below code-snippet means the method serviceA applies the `Bulkhead` policy with the semaphore approach, limiting the maximum concurrent requests to 5.

[source, java]
----
@Bulkhead(5) // maximum 5 concurrent requests allowed
public Connection serviceA() {
   Connection conn = null;
   counterForInvokingServiceA++;
   conn = connectionService();
   return conn;
}
----

When using the semaphore approach, on reaching maximum request counter, the extra request will fail with `BulkheadException`.


==== Thread pool style Bulkhead

The below code-snippet means the method serviceA applies the `Bulkhead` policy with the thread pool approach, limiting the maximum concurrent requests to 5 and the waiting queue size to 8.

[source, java]
----
// maximum 5 concurrent requests allowed, maximum 8 requests allowed in the waiting queue
@Asynchronous
@Bulkhead(value = 5, waitingTaskQueue = 8)
public Future<Connection> serviceA() {
   Connection conn = null;
   counterForInvokingServiceA++;
   conn = connectionService();
   return CompletableFuture.completedFuture(conn);
}
----


When using the thread pool approach, when a request cannot be added to the waiting queue, `BulkheadException` will be thrown.

==== Lifecycle

Bulkhead needs to maintain some state between invocations: the number of currently running executions, or the queue of waiting executions.
This state is a singleton, irrespective of the lifecycle of the bean that uses the `@Bulkhead` annotation.

More specifically, the bulkhead state is uniquely identified by the combination of the bean class (`java.lang.Class`) and the method object (`java.lang.reflect.Method`) representing the guarded method.

For example, if there's a guarded method `doWork` on a bean which is `@RequestScoped`, each request will have its own instance of the bean, but all invocations of `doWork` will share the same bulkhead state.

=== Interactions with other annotations

The `@Bulkhead` annotation can be used together with `@Fallback`, `@CircuitBreaker`, `@Asynchronous`, `@Timeout` and `@Retry`.

If a `@Fallback` is specified, it will be invoked if the `BulkheadException` is thrown.

If `@Retry` is used with `@Bulkhead`, when an invocation fails due to a `BulkheadException` it is retried after waiting for the delay configured on `@Retry`. If an invocation is permitted to run by the bulkhead but then throws another exception which is handled by `@Retry`, it first leaves the bulkhead, reducing the count of running concurrent requests by 1, waits for the delay configured on `@Retry`, and then attempts to enter the bulkhead again. At this point, it may be accepted, queued (if the method is also annotated with `@Asynchronous`) or fail with a `BulkheadException` (which may result in further retries).
