## Support files to support MicroProfile Metrics 5.0

MicroProfile Metrics 5.0 has breaking changes. To support both the 4.0 and 5.0 APIs, we need some classes which are compiled against the 5.0 API. This module contains those classes.

The classes compiled against the Metrics 5.0 API are then consumed into the main TCK jar.
